# Changelog 2025-10

October 2025 – Key Changes
- SPICE enablement across the stack – Core integration (tscircuit/core #1427 #1441), circuit-json-to-spice auto .tran & switch support (#13 #11) and Spicey transient comparison (#4 #6) introduce first-class analog simulation.
- Voltage probing & timing – New simulation_voltage_probe element (circuit-json #306) + voltage-probe component (props #432 #439) and duration/time-per-step parameters (circuit-json #305, props #437) let you chart node voltages.
- Multi-layer autorouter – 4-layer routing (autorouter #276, core #1443) with boundary-aware pathing & caching (autorouter #265 #268 #279, calculate-packing #55) dramatically improves PCB routing.
- New DRC checks – Via-to-via clearance errors (core #1459), trace-out-of-board detection (checks #79, core #1436) and component-overlap check (core #1478).
- PCB fabrication notes – Note/rect/path/dimension/courtyard primitives added to schema & Core (circuit-json #309-#313, core #1491-#1499) with matching prop definitions (props #441 #446).
- Board & hole upgrades – Board anchor/alignment (core #1438), optional title/thickness/colour (props #435 #440, core #1477) and pill-shaped holes (circuit-json #310, core #1484).
- One-command KiCad export – CLI support (cli #431) plus circuit-json-to-kicad reaching schematic+PCB parity (#1-#18).
- 3D pipeline refresh – Poppygl replaces simple-3d for PNG snapshots (cli #435 #442, stepts #9); 3D-viewer gains environment maps, FR4 material & LED colours (3d-viewer #509-#520).
- GLTF / STEP exporters – Correct bottom-mount placement & board geometry (circuit-json-to-gltf #44 #40) and customizable background/grid (poppygl #5 #7 #9).
- circuit-to-svg – Simulation graph SVGs (circuit-to-svg #337) and 4-layer PCB examples (#365) with improved styling (#352).
- Math utils – Polygon overlap / containment helpers & universal rect inputs (math-utils #23 #24).
- Website – STEP file downloads (tscircuit.com #1770), public org pages (-#1774), user settings page (-#1771) and a cleaner editor UI (-#1744).
- Misc – Outline-aware packing examples (calculate-packing #56), new maintainer MustafaMulla29 (contribution-tracker #229).
