# Changelog 2025-10

2025-10 Highlights
- SPICE comes to TSCircuit – initial core integration, voltage probes, RC charging test & transient support (core #1427, #1441, #1444-45, #1496; circuit-json-to-spice #13, #11; spicey #4, #6)
- New simulation schema – voltage_probe element, timing params, switch component, refactored time (circuit-json #302-306)
- Autorouter leaps to 4-layer & multi-layer boards with caching, via-clearance errors and board-outline DRC (core ⭐#1443, #1459, #1431; tscircuit-autorouter #276, ⭐#279, #268)
- PCB fabrication notes & dimensions supported end-to-end (circuit-json #309, #311, #313; props #441, #446; core #1491, #1493, #1499; pcb-viewer #397)
- New board features – pill-shape holes, boardAnchorPosition/alignment, optional board thickness & title (core #1484, #1438, #1477; props #440)
- Rendering overhaul – poppygl replaces legacy renderers for CLI/STEP/GLTF snapshots; env-map & FR4 material tuning, LED colours, board-outline clipping (cli #435, #442; 3d-viewer #509, #511, #520, #519; poppygl #5, #7, #9; circuit-json-to-gltf #40-44)
