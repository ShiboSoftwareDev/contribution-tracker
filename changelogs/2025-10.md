# Changelog 2025-10

- SPICE support lands – Core now integrates Spicey (initial embed + voltage probes + transient test suites) and circuit-json / props add switch & voltage-probe elements along with timing controls.
- Multi-layer PCB autorouting – Four-layer routing, polygon-outline handling, via-clearance errors and new DRC checks shipped in core + tscircuit-autorouter with optional solver caching.
- Fabrication documentation – circuit-json, props and core gain PCB note, rect, path, courtyard & dimension primitives to generate clean fab drawings.
- KiCad export workflow – `tscircuit cli` can now emit full KiCad projects; circuit-json-to-kicad adds schematic centering, pin-length fixes and PCB output.
- 3D/STEP pipeline refresh – poppygl replaces simple-3d for snapshot rendering; circuit-json-to-gltf/step add JSCAD-built PCB geometry, proper bottom-side placement and new grid / env-map options.
- Board customization – support for board title, anchor positioning/alignment, thickness, color and FR4 material properties.
- New simulation features – analog simulation element, automatic .tran generation, overlapped graph styling & staggered dashes in SVG output.
- Viewer improvements – LED model colors, board-outline clipping, enhanced layer selector and Pinout SVG export.
- Checks & QA – disconnected-trace, trace-out-of-board and different-net-via errors raised with visual SVG marks.
- Web & tooling – tscircuit.com adds STEP download, org/user settings pages; Runframe gains KiCad project download and version display; contribution-tracker adds new maintainer.
